### Cultural Cooking Assistant

We had issues with uploading our code to Github. Several copies were made and even when attempting to stage mini portions of the project at a time, it was deemed unsuccessful due to the data set that was used to train our models and vectorize all data.

Here is a link to the github repo in a google drive:

A basic static frontend page was created demonstrating how our *Cultural Cooking Assistant* works. Here is a Youtube video demonstrating the work:
